    paragraph: 'I met Li back in college at Purdue.  Although we lived a couple of dorm rooms apart our freshmen year, we didn’t hang out until my sophomore year when I pledged for our fraternity. Li took me under his wing and became my big bro. We spent a lot of time together after that in college. Once we graduated, we both ended up in the East Coast where the douchebaggery continued. The good times rolled until I moved to California two plus years ago. Deep inside, he probably missed the good times we had, and that’s why he’s moving here to SF so we can continue all the shenanigans we used to do. Ok, maybe at 50% level, because we are getting old.'

Although he was two years older than me, he was someone that I could look up to since he graduated on time, which is a rare occurrence back in the days.  While the both of us worked in NY back in the summer of ‘03, he introduced me to my favorite restaurant in NYC, Oh Taisho, which I’m forever grateful for.'

    paragraph: 'Arnold and I first met during my first few weeks in Purdue, on the way to Indiana University as part of a Taiwanese Student Association event.  I knew right away we would be good friends.  His passion for alcohol and drinking games is second to none.  Knowing me, you can easily see why we are close.  Furthermore,  we both grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, and we share the same passion for Chicago sports teams (minus the White Sox).'

    paragraph: 'I’ve known David since freshman year in high school, back when baggy jeans and XL-sized clothing were popular.  We spent a great deal of time together working at Target and playing video games (mostly DDR).  This continued to college where we both attended Purdue.  As we grew older, our hobbies changed:  instead of DDR, we upgrade to NB2K1 on Sega Saturn, where David was an unstoppable force with Vince Carter.'

    paragraph: 'As part of our fraternity in Purdue and a fellow EE student, Jimmy and I shared many similar traits.  Thus, it’s only natural that when I looked for a career change, he was the only that took the leap of faith with me and applied for Hack Reactor.  Luckily, we both got in at the same time and we were assigned to the same class.  It was a difficult three months, especially living in a garage converted studio together.  Not sure if I would have ever made it without Jimmy.'

    paragraph: 'Ray was my partner in crime when we both lived in Philadelphia.  An epic night in Old City would start at Drinkers Pub and end up at Mint Night Club.  When we roll in, the ladies in Philadelphia didn’t stand a chance (ok, I made part up).  Nonetheless, we always had a good time.  More importantly, it was our snowboarding hobby that brought us closer.  The yearly snowboarding trips to West Coast and Poconos will be memories that I will always cherish.'

Anne is the best older sister one can have, although it didn’t start like that to begin with (she was very bossy and demanding growing up).
